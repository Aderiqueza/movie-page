      Created by Chinaza Onuzo and Dami Elebe, with the latter serving as head writer, Far From Home is on course to launch globally and exclusively on Netflix from 16th December 2022.

      The five-episode series follows protagonist Ishaya, whose laser focus on achieving his dreams takes him to the glitzy prestigious A-level school Wilmer Academy where the trappings of wealth will prove irresistible. However, underneath the shiny façade of the well-heeled, lies danger and deception with Ishayas reality refusing to stay buried. 
The series features an eclectic mix of Nollywood’s formidable talents.
